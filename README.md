# Python-Data-Analysis-of-a-Document-Tracker
A Python program that analyses large JSON files, and plots data to various different graphs.

This program was developed for a university coursework. The coursework required us to develop a Python-based application, that analyses and displays document tracking data from issuu.com, which is a platform for publishing documents. Data was to be read from JSON files and plotted to bar graphs, or an "also read" directed graph.

The program can be run with a GUI, or as a command line interface.
